<h1>Interaction Flow Example</h1>
<h2>Precondition</h2>
Sonya wants to post a video to TikTok.
<h2>Postcondition</h2>
<ol>
    <li>From the home page, Sonya taps the add content button on the bottom of the screen.</li>
    <li>TikTok brings her to the proprietary recording suite.</li>
    <li>Since Sonya does all of her recording and editing on her laptop, she taps the upload button</li>
    <li>The app opens her phones gallery, defaulted to her video folder</li>
    <li>She taps the video she wants to upload.</li>
    <li>The app returns to the recording suite, to allow her to review and further edit her video</li>
    <li>After reviewing her video, she clicks next</li>
    <li>The app takes her to the finalization screen</li>
    <li>She describes her video, and adds her favorite and relevant hashtags, and taps post</li>
    <li>TikTok uploads her video in the background, and sorts her video into the relevant hash tags and user algorithms so she shows up in interested users "for you page."</li>
</ol>
